Dear Dr Catherine Hurley,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Taking the Scenic Route: Interactive and Performant Tour Animations" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new CRAN package called `detourr`, which provides interactive and performant tour animations for exploring high-dimensional data. This package builds on top of `tourr` and implements a set of display tools using `htmlwidgets` and TypeScript that allows for rich interactions such as orbit controls, scrubbing, brushing, and tooltips. Web technologies such as `Three.js` and `TensorFlow.js` are used to enable good animation performance for large datasets. `detourr` has modern user API inspired by `ggplot2` and the tidy data workflow. This article is written in markdown and contains reproducible code examples, with an interactive widget included in the HTML version.

We believe this article is a good fit for the R journal, because it features a novel implementation of tour animations with and a modern, intuitive user experience in R.
