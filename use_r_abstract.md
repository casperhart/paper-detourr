The _tour_ is a useful tool for exploring high dimensional datasets. It works by combining a sequence of projections---the tour path---in to an animation---the display method. In R these display methods are usually limited to the R graphics device, or exporting to disk or external tools. This limits their interactivity, portability, and often leads to poor performance and jerky animations even for small datasets.

We introduce the {detourr} package, which provides a set of display methods implemented in Javascript. These display methods include interactive features such as orbit controls, scrubbing, tooltips, point selection, and brushing, and we achieve smooth animations for large datasets using Three.js and WebGL. {detourr} uses {htmlwidgets} as the interface between R and Javascript, so the resulting animations are portable and accessible using a wide range of browsers and devices. It provides a declarative API and is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of custom display methods either from scratch or using existing display methods as a base.
