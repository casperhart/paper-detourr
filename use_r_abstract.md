When analyzing high dimensional data, it can be difficult to gain an intuitive understanding of the structure of the data and the interesting features which may be hidden from view.
One method for exploring such high dimensional data is the tour, which consists of a tour path---a sequence of projections---and a display method---to draw the sequence as an animation. The {tourr} package (reference) produces tours that can be viewed in the R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk.

Here we introduce the {detourr} package, which extends {tourr} with a new set of display methods implemented in Javascript. These display methods provide interactive features such as orbit controls, scrubbing, tooltips, point selection, and brushing. We achieve smooth animations for large datasets using Three.js and WebGL, and the animations can be viewed in the RStudio viewer, embedded into HTML documents and Shiny applications, or can be viewed in any browser. The interface between R and Javascript is provided by {htmlwidgets} and linking with other widgets is supported through {crosstalk}.
