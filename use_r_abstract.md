The _tour_ provides a useful vehicle for exploring high dimensional datasets. It works by combining a sequence of projections---the tour path---in to an animation---the display method. Current display implementations in R are limited in their interactivity and portability, resulting in poor performance and jerky animations even for small datasets.

We take a detour into web technologies, such as Three.js and WebGL, to support smooth and performant tour visualisations. The R package {detourr} implements a set of display tools in Typescript that allow for rich interactions (including orbit controls, scrubbing, and brushing) and smooth animations for large datasets. It provides a declarative R interface using {htmlwidgets} and supports linked views using {crosstalk} and R Shiny. The resulting animations are portable and accessible across a wide range of browsers and devices. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of custom display methods either from scratch or using existing display methods as a base.
